//Test Case Result Counter

// After a test suite runs, you receive an array of test results (strings: "pass", "fail", "skip"). 
// Write a JavaScript program using a for loop that counts how many tests passed, failed, and were skipped. 
// Print a test report with total tests, counts, pass rate percentage, and a verdict 
// (all passed → ready for release, ≤2 failures → review, >2 failures → block release).
